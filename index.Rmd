### Introduction
Hello! My name is Jasmin Martinez (she/her/ella) and I am originally from Northern Virginia and El Salvador. I am a first-generation Latina student at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health, currently pursuing my MPH in Epidemiology with a Applied Biostatistics and Data Science certificate. I completed my B.S. in Biology and Kinesiology at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg,VA in May 2023. 

I am deeply interested to health disparities research, especially in the Latino community. Additionally, I am interested in the impact of medication adherence and language barriers on health outcomes. 

### Hobbies
In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction, watching documentaries, running, baking, and cooking!
